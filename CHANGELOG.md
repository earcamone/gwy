# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - XXXX-XX-XX

This is the first official release beta. 

The project has been [extensively tested](https://github.com/earcamone/gwy-playground/actions)
but because, at the end of the day, it's a sole programmer project, I'm leaving
some space for possible bugs reporting so, if you find some, kindly report them.
